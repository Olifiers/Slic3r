    <description><![CDATA[
The previous release contained a bug which caused blobbing on layer change, so you're urged to download this one before yelling at your favorite slicing program!

<h4>New features:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>new options to <b>customize support material</b>: pattern, spacing, overhang angle threshold, pattern angle</li>
    <li>new option to <b>disable the automatic addition of perimeters</b> for sloping walls</li>
    <li>new <i>brim</i> feature to improve adhesion (as requested by the community!)</i>
</ul>

<h4>Improvements:</h4>
<ul>
    <li><b>support material now works with all geometries</b> (not just flat overhangs)</li>
    <li>perimeters now keep the <b>full accuracy and resolution</b> of the original model</li>
    <li>honeycomb travel moves were optimized</li>
</ul>

<h4>Changes:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>skirt loops are now extruded from outside to inside</li>
    <li>arc geometry compensation was disabled</li>
</ul>

<h4>Bugfixes:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>any <i>retraction_lift</i> value different from "0" caused no retraction on layer change, thus blobbing</li>
    <li><i>first_layer_speed</i> was accepting mm/m values rather than mm/s</li>
    <li>some infill lines were not always connected near the perimeters</li>
    <li>ratio inputs were not accepted on command line</li>
    <li>ratio inputs were always converted to absolute values on config saving</li>
    <li>when skirt distance was set to zero, the first loop coincided with the external perimeter of the object</li>
    <li>first layer extrusion width was computed using general layer height rather first layer height</li>
</ul>

    <description><![CDATA[
This release aims to fix pending bugs and address stability.
A number of <a href="https://github.com/alexrj/Slic3r/commits/master">contributors</a> helped with patches and testing.

Note: the Mac executable requires OS X 10.6. I'm working on a 10.5 package; meanwhile, Mac Leopard users can use 0.7.2b.

<h4>New features:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>new advanced options to <i>customize extrusion width</i> for first layer, perimeters and infill</li>
    <li>new separate <b>speed setting for top solid surfaces</b></li>
    <li>new algorithm to <b>fill gaps</b> (corners, little regions, vase walls only allowing for an odd number of loops etc.)</li>
    <li>experimental support material generation for DLP in SVG export</li>
</ul>

<h4>Improvements:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>better detection of <i>thin walls</i></li>
    <li>avoid perimeter collisions</li>
    <li>accept both relative and absolute values for extrusion width, first layer speed, first layer height (relative values can be expressed as percentage, e.g. <i>80%</i>)</li>
    <li>allow to load multiple files at once in the plater</li>
    <li>always ask confirmation when overwriting existing STL files</li>
    <li>warn user when an object can't be split</li>
    <li>pass config options as environment variables to post-processing scripts</li>
</ul>

<h4>Changes:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>renamed "Perimeters" to "Perimeters (minimum)" to avoid confusion caused by automatic additional perimeters</li>
    <li>renamed <i>bottom layer speed</i> to <i>first layer speed</i> for consistency</li>
    <li>always set bed temperature after first layer if first layer temperature is set</li>
</ul>

<h4>Bugfixes:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>fixed regression causing many bridges to be extruded with a wrong direction</li>
    <li>fixed regression causing skirt to be limited to the first layer</li>
    <li>fixed regression causing some models not to be sliced correctly</li>
    <li>fixed regression causing SVG export to be incomplete</li>
    <li>arc compensation was applied to non-circular holes too, causing them to be too large</li>
    <li>retraction wasn't triggered when moving between infill of different islands using low density infill</li>
    <li>fixed <i>slic3r-console.exe</i> (on Windows) not working in previous 0.8.x releases</li>
    <li>Z wasn't lifted when changing layer</li>
    <li>the preview area was not updating to the largest side of the build plate</li>
    <li>the <i>Export SVG...</i> menu item was not working</li>
    <li>Growl notifications now work from the plater too</li>
</ul>

This is a very important update, grab it now and enjoy!
I want to say thanks to the wonderful community that has been helping with feedback, early testing and nice ideas. A lot of people is involved in our open "quality assurance" process!

<h4>New features:</h4>
<ul>
    <li><b>graphical interface for composing multiple objects</b> in one single print (with tools for rotation, scaling etc.)</li>
    <li>new <b>--merge</b> switch to compose multiple object with auto-positioning from command line</li>
    <li>new option to <b>randomize starting points</b> across layers</li>
    <li>automatic detection of additional required perimeters for avoiding haps in domed/sloping objects (the <i>perimeters</i> settings means now <i>minimum perimeters</i> as Slic3r could add more when needed)</li>
    <li><b>sequential printing</b>: print a complete object, then move onto next one, with automatic collision detection</li>
    <li>ability to <b>export STL</b> files of composed plates, as well as a <b>Split</b> command to turn multi-object files into individual objects</li>
    <li>we can read <b>OBJ</b> files now</li>
</ul>

<h4>Improvements:</h4>
<ul>
    <li><b>very large memory savings</b> and speed boosts, allowing to process high-resolutions files without getting out of memory; also, the number of threads is customizable</li>
    <li>very <b>improved surface quality</b> due to new smoothing algorithms</li>
    <li>the GUI doesn't block while slicing and a <b>Cancel</b> button was added to stop the process</li>
    <li>hole perimeters are extruded in reverse order (from the outermost to the innermost) to get better overhangs</li>
    <li>a slight compensation is applied to avoid small hole shrinkage</li>
    <li>support material now uses honeycomb pattern (much work is still needed on support material)</li>
    <li>retract before changing tool for dual extrusion</li>
</ul>

<h4>Changes:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>SVG colors were inverted to better support DLP printing (next versions will carry more settings for SVG export)</li>
</ul>

<h4>Bugfixes:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>fixed some GUI memory leaks</li>
    <li>fixed some fatal errors</li>
    <li>fixed a bug causing high memory consumption when infilling every 2 or more layers</li>
    <li>some holes where filled</li>
    <li>some nearly-thin walls were discarded</li>
    <li>removed tiny dots/blobs that were generated sometimes</li>
    <li>bottom layer speed ratio wasn't taken into account when estimating layer time</li>
    <li>omit any G92 E0 when in relative mode</li>
</ul>
